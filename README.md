# Monger

Monger is an idiomatic Clojure wrapper around MongoDB Java driver.


## Usage

Before documentation guides & examples are written (targeted for the 1.0 release), it is fair to say that it is *likely to be unusable* to anyone
other than the author.


## This is a Work In Progress

Core Monger APIs are stabilized but it is still a work in progress. Keep that in mind.


## Artifacts

Snapshot artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.novemberain/monger) every few days.

With Leiningen:

    [com.novemberain/monger "0.10.0-SNAPSHOT"]

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.novemberain</groupId>
      <artifactId>monger</artifactId>
